What is at \u000d\u000athe heart of the issue is that, as intelligent beings, we are not condemned solely to \u000d\u000aspontaneous mechanisms (e.g. the free market), but we can (and do so with increasing \u000d\u000asuccess) create reality. Creation can be qualitatively different. It can be a strictly \u000d\u000aeconomic creation (understood as an intentional and planned action), which does not \u000d\u000awork out well for us as humanity, but it can also be a creation relating to the greatest \u000d\u000anatural attribute of humans, which is our cognitive functions, namely intelligence. \u000d\u000aFor this reason, however, it is better to call humans Homo sapiens instead of Homo \u000d\u000aoeconomicus. \u000d\u000aIt is the widespread development of education and investment in science in the \u000d\u000abroadest sense as fully intentional and planned actions that have brought exponential \u000d\u000agrowth in civilisational development and prosperity to humanity. They have done so to \u000d\u000aa greater extent than the spontaneous free market process, without detracting \u000d\u000aanything from it. Moreover, man, being an intelligent being who acts consciously, is \u000d\u000aultimately condemned to act intentionally to a greater extent than spontaneous \u000d\u000aprocesses, because intentionality, especially with technological development, can \u000d\u000aincreasingly harm these processes (including the free market). Man is ultimately \u000d\u000acondemned to an almost fully technologised and created reality, which he will not only \u000d\u000abe able to, but above all have to, correct himself. \u000d\u000aAs we know very well, spontaneous processes do not like correction. It can \u000d\u000aparadoxically be said that man, thanks to his intentional nature, is increasingly \u000d\u000adistorting the free market, which is a spontaneous mechanism, and this is an \u000d\u000airreversible process. Therefore, in the future, we will necessarily have less and less free \u000d\u000amarket in the free market (in fact, this is already happening today) and more and more \u000d\u000atechnologised creation. Rather, the free market as such will not annihilate, but will \u000d\u000amost likely become a marginal phenomenon. \u000d\u000aThe fact that economic processes are highly complex and emergent phenomena, \u000d\u000adifficult or impossible for humans to replicate, does not mean that we must be \u000d\u000acondemned to this process or to its duplication by, for example, artificial intelligence. \u000d\u000aThanks to our cognitive abilities as beings with sufficiently highly developed \u000d\u000aintelligence, we are able to create substitute processes, often even better from the \u000d\u000apoint of view of our utility than the source/natural processes. \u000d\u000aThanks to air transport, we are able to travel great distances at high speed. This was \u000d\u000amade possible by the aeroplane \u2013 the result of human cognitive abilities. Although the \u000d\u000aconstruction of the aeroplane's components responsible for the lifting force is a major \u000d\u000asimplification of the evolutionary work with which birds have been equipped, the human \u000d\u000ainvention beats this evolutionary invention by its utility value (covering great distances \u000d\u000ain a relatively short time). ","The complexity of economic processes, despite their simple idea of a flow of goods and \u000d\u000aservices from the producer to the consumer, is largely due, among other things, to the \u000d\u000acomplex system of supply chains. This is because the production of goods is currently \u000d\u000astill a multi-stage process, dependent on the cooperation of numerous actors \u000d\u000aspecialising in the production of a relatively narrow range of products even within a \u000d\u000asingle industry. The production of more complex goods, e.g. an aeroplane or a car, is \u000d\u000aoften dispersed over a large geographical area and this inevitably causes major \u000d\u000alogistical challenges, also for the economy. \u000d\u000aThe point is that this does not have to be the case in the future, and that the increase \u000d\u000ain the universal manufacturing capacity of individual economic players, together with \u000d\u000athe advances in robotisation and automation, will significantly reduce the supply chain \u000d\u000aand free production processes from logistical nuisances. It should even be stated that \u000d\u000athe more modern the economy is, the more inherently less complex the organisational \u000d\u000aand logistical aspects become, which are the main cause of the complexity and \u000d\u000aemergent nature of its processes. \u000d\u000aThis is just one example of how previously considered unsolvable problems are \u000d\u000abecoming solvable thanks to the progress of science and human cognitive abilities. \u000d\u000aUsing this analogy, at a high level of generality, one can conclude that these \u000d\u000aregularities apply to virtually all complex issues. The prerequisite for this is, of course, \u000d\u000athat not profit, but science in the broadest sense, with its optimum use thanks to \u000d\u000aintellectual potential, is placed at the centre. \u000d\u000aIf we look around carefully, we can see that most things, although obvious, are no \u000d\u000alonger natural to us \u2013 general living conditions e.g. housing (buildings instead of caves) \u000d\u000aor food (agricultural cultivation), the settlement of high latitudes, complex medical \u000d\u000atreatments, transport, high technology, computing, artificial intelligence and countless \u000d\u000aaspects related to the development of our civilisation. Along the way, we inevitably \u000d\u000acreate new emergent processes even without being fully aware of them, often \u000d\u000asurpassing in complexity those that are a 'product' of nature. A good example of \u000d\u000athis is the aforementioned artificial intelligence, certain aspects of which, related to its \u000d\u000alearning, are a mystery to its creators themselves! \u000d\u000aExtrapolating the above examples to economic issues, the effects will be similar. \u000d\u000aThe conundrum is not a question of 'if' but 'when'. Keeping all things in proportion to \u000d\u000athe scale of the challenge of harnessing the economy (including globally) through our \u000d\u000acognitive abilities using new technologies, it is clear that this is not some qualitative \u000d\u000aexception. It is more of a quantitative issue, the solution of which will simply require \u000d\u000amore time in proportion to the other challenges. Besides, an immanent feature of the \u000d\u000astructure of the human psyche is scepticism and a lack of imagination and faith in the \u000d\u000acapabilities of the human mind, which often surprises us, probably because of our \u000d\u000alimited knowledge of it. Man's historical and eternal desire to rise above the earth into \u000d\u000athe air, being a classic example of utopia through the ages, best illustrates this. \u000d\u000aContrary to various opinions based on the selfish gene and the principle guided by pure \u000d\u000aegoism, man as a very complex structure is also capable of altruistic behaviour in the \u000d\u000aemotional field, and not only at the individual level, but also at the herd level, moreover \u000d\u000ain a systemic manner. Examples of such social behaviour are the tax system or the \u000d\u000aawareness of the common good, and many other more or less abstract attitudes that \u000d\u000ahave no counterparts in the natural world. Our level of development also makes it ","possible to understand that the world is a very complex structure and that many of \u000d\u000athese systemic, altruistic behaviours are capable of producing an overall benefit in the \u000d\u000along term. \u000d\u000aWithout the use of cognitive abilities, the economic processes themselves \u000d\u000a(or, if you prefer, the economics of human behaviour in general), in the \u000d\u000acontext of civilisational development and well-being, would essentially be a \u000d\u000azero-sum equation. We can see this in the example of all other species, which, \u000d\u000adeprived of our level of development and only retaining their own \u000d\u000abehaviourism, have not been able to improve their own well-being since the \u000d\u000abeginning of their existence for millions of years. They do not evolve in a \u000d\u000afunctional sense as fast as humans, the exception in nature. \u000d\u000aTherefore, we need an approach that is more focused on optimized and maximized use \u000d\u000aof the potential of our cognitive abilities, rather than focusing solely on strictly \u000d\u000aeconomic and economic solutions. The economy and economics cannot be an end in \u000d\u000athemselves, but one of the means leading to the goal, which should be the \u000d\u000adevelopment of civilisation and human well-being in the broadest sense. Nothing is \u000d\u000abetter suited to achieving this goal than our cognitive abilities and the broad \u000d\u000aengagement of science. \u000d\u000aA key principle to understand about the economy is that although the free market is a \u000d\u000anatural and spontaneous phenomenon, it is not compatible with human nature. \u000d\u000aMan, although undoubtedly derived from nature, as a general rule, his behavior and the \u000d\u000adecisions he makes of all kinds, in statistical terms, stand in complete contrast to the \u000d\u000arest of the species. Being an intelligent being, he is not guided by instincts, but takes \u000d\u000aintentional, i.e. unspontaneous actions. In the economic context, the consequences of \u000d\u000asuch functioning are fundamental! This is the key to realizing one of the most \u000d\u000asignificant, if not the most significant, cognitive error with regard to an economy \u000d\u000afounded on the free market paradigm. \u000d\u000aThis principle reads: The natural asymmetric nature of human actions \u000d\u000a(intentionality), which stands in contrast to the linear nature of economic \u000d\u000aassumptions (predictability of the algorithms that govern these assumptions), \u000d\u000aincluding the free market, necessitates the need to apply control over certain \u000d\u000aeconomic processes in a coordinated manner (using technology, emerging \u000d\u000athrough science, i.e. the highly developed cognitive functions of man), in order \u000d\u000ato reduce the undesirable inertia that characterises classical economics \u000d\u000a(unpredictability of the negative effects of, among other things, the free \u000d\u000amarket).\u000d\u000aCapitalist, feudal or socialist/communist concepts are all more or less irrational and \u000d\u000aoppressive in their own way, and as such are emanations of the culture of different eras \u000d\u000aand human emotions. All these concepts, although strongly antagonised with each \u000d\u000aother, have one thing in common \u2013 they are first and foremost ends in themselves, \u000d\u000afocused on the distribution of the final element of the economy, which is the good \u000d\u000aproduced, instead of using a holistic and consequently more efficient strategy. \u000d\u000aTherefore, a more fundamental change is needed than at the level of the production of \u000d\u000agoods and their distribution. What is needed is a change at the level of the strategy of \u000d\u000aproducing these goods, focusing on the benefits of civilisation. ","Man, as a rational being, possessing in nature the greatest asset necessary for the \u000d\u000adevelopment of the well-being of his species, i.e. intelligence, both individually and \u000d\u000asocially, should primarily focus on the development of civilisation without the use of \u000d\u000aintermediate tools, wasting energy, time and resources. If we focus more exclusively on \u000d\u000athe distribution of wealth and individual gains, the more we will all lose out. \u000d\u000aBy failing to make optimal use of intellectual resources already at the level of the \u000d\u000astrategy of producing these goods \u2013 analysing their quality, general availability or the \u000d\u000arationality of using the resources necessary for their production \u2013 we create \u000d\u000adevelopmental limitations for ourselves as a community. \u000d\u000aIf we do not have a proper strategy, we become hostage to economic development, \u000d\u000aenvironmental degradation, the waste of precious natural resources or the production \u000d\u000aof goods with a deadline, because we have to produce and sell more and more in \u000d\u000aorder to guarantee financial profit and employment. In the long run, this is a road to \u000d\u000anowhere. \u000d\u000aThe overriding value should be the development of civilisation as a whole and its \u000d\u000awell-being, because this is simply rational and most profitable for everyone \u2013 most \u000d\u000aimportantly, also in the long term. If we put the matter this way, it can be seen that all \u000d\u000athe three socio-economic orders mentioned are closer to each other than to a position \u000d\u000athat focuses on intellectual/scientific potential for the sake of the good and interest of \u000d\u000aall. \u000d\u000aEconomies focusing on the mere production of goods, their distribution and the profit \u000d\u000afrom their sale, will necessarily not be committed to their easy availability, as this will \u000d\u000aclearly conflict with their purpose and interests. \u000d\u000aAs living beings and 'consumers' of oxygen, we are not interested in whether the air is \u000d\u000acapitalist, communist or feudal. For humans, the most important value is the very fact \u000d\u000athat it simply is. There is enough of it for everyone and, fortunately, none of the \u000d\u000aabove-mentioned socio-economic orders need to involve themselves in its distribution. \u000d\u000aThis state of affairs serves everyone, because we can exist peacefully. We do not have \u000d\u000ato pay to consume it as part of a capitalist business licensed to do so. Nor is it \u000d\u000aforbidden to breathe fully under ideological tyranny. And there are also no restrictions \u000d\u000aby virtue of servitude to a feudal who has usurped ownership of all natural goods. \u000d\u000aOf course, air is an example of a good available in unlimited quantity, which is a gift to \u000d\u000aus from nature, but on the other hand it symbolises true, unconditional freedom. \u000d\u000aThis example is just a signpost for us in which direction we can and should go. \u000d\u000aFor short-term gains of dubious quality for our entire species, it is not worthwhile to \u000d\u000amove towards systems that primarily feed themselves. \u000d\u000aIt is in the interest of each of us as well as the community as a whole to use man's \u000d\u000agreatest asset \u2013 reason \u2013 in a coordinated, most efficient and optimal way. \u000d\u000aSylwester Fiet ","","","THE OPTIMIZED \u000d\u000aECONOMY \u000d\u000aMANIFESTO \u000d\u000aOptimized Economy \u2013 \u000d\u000aAn economic model based \u000d\u000aon the potential of science \u000d\u000aS y l w e s t e r F i e t \u000d\u000a2 0 2 3 ","","Table of Contents \u000d\u000aChapter 1 \u000d\u000aThe Optimized Economy as an economic model ................................. 5 \u000d\u000a 1.1 Three levels of the economy ..................................................... 5 \u000d\u000a 1.2 Examples of the use of science in the economy ........................ 6 \u000d\u000a 1.3 Public sector involvement ......................................................... 8 \u000d\u000aChapter 2 \u000d\u000aMarket mechanisms and human nature ............................................. 9 \u000d\u000a 2.1 Free market versus intentional action ...................................... 9 \u000d\u000a 2.2 The dissonance between classical economics and progress ...... 12 \u000d\u000aChapter 3 \u000d\u000aSynthesis of economic and scientific activities ................................ 14 \u000d\u000a 3.1 Historical stages of welfare creation ...................................... 14 \u000d\u000a 3.2 The key role of intellectual capacity ....................................... 16 \u000d\u000a 3.3 Cognitive errors in assessing the status quo .......................... 19 \u000d\u000a 3.4 Conclusions and objectives to be pursued .............................. 22 \u000d\u000aList of graphics ................................................................................ 25","","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 5 \u000d\u000aChapter 1 \u2013 The Optimized Economy as an economic model \u000d\u000a1.1 Three levels of the economy \u000d\u000aThe economy, due to the fundamental role material goods play in human life, both \u000d\u000aindividually and socially, is a key element of human civilisation.\u000d\u000aThe most important link in the economy is not the property relations, even though \u000d\u000athey are the ones that, for historical reasons and human nature, evoke the most \u000d\u000aemotion and thus focus the most attention on themselves, but the broader strategy of \u000d\u000aproducing material goods.\u000d\u000aMeanwhile, the economy over the course of history has become hostage to property \u000d\u000arelations and the associated numerous, ideologised disputes over economic systems \u000d\u000a(including private property versus state property) and economics as such, often \u000d\u000abecoming an irrational and inefficient means to an end, and sometimes even an end in \u000d\u000aitself, which should be the development of civilisation and the well-being of the human \u000d\u000aspecies.\u000d\u000aIt is an appropriate, i.e. optimized and thus effective strategy of producing \u000d\u000agoods based on intellectual potential, or more precisely on broadly \u000d\u000aunderstood science: research and development activities, new technologies \u000d\u000aand investments in these aspects \u2013 with a special role of the public sector in \u000d\u000athis respect, also in the context of creating new economic entities \u2013 and \u000d\u000ataking into account rationality, social needs, availability of natural resources,\u000d\u000aenvironmental conditions or, finally, the very quality of produced goods, that \u000d\u000ashould be the main driving force and the key to achieving prosperity and \u000d\u000acivilisational success. It is at this level/stage of the economy (LEVEL II in the \u000d\u000agraphic below) that the greatest opportunities are found.","Page 6 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aGraphic 1 \u2013 Three levels/stages of the economy \u000d\u000aState involvement in such processes is important not only from the point of view of \u000d\u000aorganisational and financial capacity, but also because of institutional, scientific and \u000d\u000aeducational potential. However, it is important that such projects are carried out both \u000d\u000aby state actors at central and regional level and by private actors, as well as through \u000d\u000acooperation and public-private partnerships.\u000d\u000aMore important than the forms of cooperation in the implementation of these projects \u000d\u000ais the development of an appropriate culture in society and sustainable and good \u000d\u000astandards for the symbiosis of economy and science, not focused solely on a quick \u000d\u000areturn and short-term financial gain, but maximising the effectiveness in achieving the \u000d\u000aoverall benefits of civilisation.\u000d\u000a1.2 Examples of the use of science in the economy \u000d\u000aThe science-based economy is not an abstract project, but a proven method in, \u000d\u000aamong others, South Korea, where a great leap in technology and civilisation has \u000d\u000abeen achieved through the use of a number of innovative projects, implemented in \u000d\u000athe country's economy. Although the methods used in this case themselves can be \u000d\u000adebated, in principle, South Korea is a practical example, taking the right direction.\u000d\u000aAnother very tangible and symptomatic example of the tangible benefits of directly \u000d\u000aapplying scientific processes to the economy, permanently changing the standard of","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 7\u000d\u000aliving of societies and every individual, was the Manhattan Project. This historic \u000d\u000aproject had an enormous impact on the reality after the Second World War, giving the \u000d\u000aworld global peace for many decades. Despite its partly destructive nature, it also \u000d\u000acontributed to a major technological leap in civil nuclear power and the energy sector \u000d\u000aas a whole, with an impact on the efficiency of the entire economy that is difficult to \u000d\u000aoverestimate.\u000d\u000aThis example makes it perfectly clear that the economy alone is not the tool to \u000d\u000aguarantee the best pace of civilisational development, using market systems alone, \u000d\u000adespite the intellectual potential that man possesses which is necessary for this. \u000d\u000aMarket mechanisms on their own are not capable of perceiving and, above all, \u000d\u000arealising undertakings with such potential. The free market process, for objective \u000d\u000areasons and its natural limitations \u2013 including financial constraints \u2013 operates on the \u000d\u000abasis of a simple algorithm of the law of supply and demand. It is therefore \u000d\u000acharacterised by its rather limited scope and the environment in which it operates. \u000d\u000aThis phenomenon does not only apply to projects on such a large scale, but also to \u000d\u000aprojects of greater complexity than those it handles on a daily basis. \u000d\u000aThe Apollo Programme, responsible for the landing of man on the moon, can be taken \u000d\u000aas another example, which resulted in the creation or modernisation of many \u000d\u000atechnologies already in place and subsequently used in various industries.\u000d\u000aThe graphic below illustrates the advantage of economic investment using a scientific \u000d\u000abase over the classic model, which is geared solely towards a quick rate of return.","Page 8 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aGraphic 2 \u2013 Comparison of two investment models \u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a1.3 Public sector involvement \u000d\u000aCertainly, in constructing a science-based model, there is a need to strike the right \u000d\u000abalance between the fundamental issue of responsibility for the general good and the \u000d\u000apublic sector and the economic freedom of the private sector, while maintaining \u000d\u000acooperation and dialogue between all parties and social control over these processes \u000d\u000ain the spirit of democracy and respect for the human rights of the individual and \u000d\u000asociety.

However, it is worth bearing in mind that in an increasingly \u000d\u000acomplex world, ownership as such can take on a character beyond the classical \u000d\u000amodels. \u000d\u000aIn addition to the competitive element, the collaborative element is equally \u000d\u000aimportant. It is optimal when the synthesis of all types of activities \u000d\u000aultimately results not in their collision but in their synergy. ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 9\u000d\u000aContrary to intuition, in addition to strictly humanistic reasons, such a model also has \u000d\u000aa very tangible and practical justification. In the long term, it benefits everyone, \u000d\u000abecause the world we live in is a system of interconnected vessels with a tendency to \u000d\u000adeepen all interdependencies, and new technologies and scientific achievements, \u000d\u000aspread globally and permanently improve living standards. \u000d\u000aIt should be borne in mind that economic freedom is a very important element in the \u000d\u000acontext of the implementation of creative and scientific processes, giving freedom and \u000d\u000aindependence of action. On the other hand, processes initiated by the public sector or \u000d\u000apublic-private partnerships may guarantee increased competitiveness in achieving not \u000d\u000aonly better financial results, but, above all, by forcing an increase in the standards \u000d\u000aand quality of the final results obtained, translating directly into civilisational \u000d\u000adevelopment in its entire spectrum, and thus into the optimal development\u000d\u000aand well-being of the entire, human population.\u000d\u000aChapter 2 \u2013 Market mechanisms and human nature \u000d\u000a2.1 Free market versus intentional action \u000d\u000aAn inherent, essential and natural part of the economy has almost always been the \u000d\u000afree market, in which goods are exchanged through voluntary transactions between \u000d\u000ainterested parties. \u000d\u000aThere is also no doubt that this essentially simple algorithm based on the law of \u000d\u000asupply and demand has played a great role in the history of mankind and positively \u000d\u000ainfluenced the development of civilisation. The free market brings with it valuable \u000d\u000avalues such as freedom, creativity, stimulation for entrepreneurship and many \u000d\u000amotivational factors. However, it is above all what people make it. \u000d\u000aLike most natural mechanisms, it is burdened with a high degree of inertia. \u000d\u000aIts reactivity, especially in an environment of human behaviourism, based on very \u000d\u000adifferent laws to this simple algorithm, paradoxically makes its natural origin, no \u000d\u000alonger an advantage. \u000d\u000aIn order to realise the gravity of the implications of the elementary difference \u000d\u000aseparating man from the rest of reality, even though he is an integral part of it, it \u000d\u000asuffices to observe man comparatively with the rest of the natural world and the \u000d\u000aphenomena or entire physical systems occurring in nature with particular reference to \u000d\u000atheir fundamental division into behaviour. \u000d\u000aHuman intentional action is the key to understanding the whole issue, as it is \u000d\u000athe factor that can overturn all the assumptions and theoretical models of \u000d\u000avarious mechanisms, including the free market. \u000d\u000aIntentionality, which is characterised by a high degree of unpredictability and \u000d\u000aresistance to statistics, apart from human behaviour, is essentially a phenomenon \u000d\u000athat does not occur in nature. Ignoring this phenomenon of nature, if only from a ","Page 10 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000amathematical point of view, necessarily has to be fraught with consequences and \u000d\u000aoften becomes a prime cause of subsequent misunderstandings. It can even be the \u000d\u000asource of a domino effect of many cognitive errors, among others, in fields dealing \u000d\u000awith economics. \u000d\u000aThe issues described here should not be combined and confused with the concept of \u000d\u000aentropy, which in nature balances ordered states. Economic processes and human \u000d\u000ainteractions with them are local phenomena, characterised by very unrepresentative \u000d\u000aproperties and relations with respect to a general account of the law of entropy, as \u000d\u000awell as the associated second law of thermodynamics. \u000d\u000aHuman behaviour based on intentional action is basically the opposite of the \u000d\u000abehaviour of other systems, which are characterised by spontaneity and lack of order, \u000d\u000aor the mere randomness of events. Furthermore, there are many downplayed but \u000d\u000afundamental elements that distinguish human behaviour from the animal world, \u000d\u000aalthough certain similarities tempt us to make comparisons with it. \u000d\u000aSomewhat simplistically, the animal world functions through instincts, which can be \u000d\u000acompared to more or less complex but reasonably predictable algorithms. \u000d\u000aHuman activity, on the other hand, is a conglomeration of many complex elements: \u000d\u000alogical thinking, highly structured actions, abstract thinking, complex emotions and \u000d\u000aintentional actions, characterised in their general trend by a high coefficient of \u000d\u000aunpredictability. \u000d\u000aThese are factors that are so radically different from the rest of organisms that, with \u000d\u000atheir characteristics and consequences, they go far beyond strictly biological criteria, \u000d\u000amaking their mark far more strongly than one might think, right down to the level of \u000d\u000aphysical systems. \u000d\u000aThis is why humans evolve so quickly in their behaviour, unlike animals, in all spheres \u000d\u000aof life. The domain of the economy is no exception. Unlike the animal world, it is not \u000d\u000abased solely on natural law, but also operates in an environment of legislated law, \u000d\u000awhich is unprecedented in the natural world and the behaviour of herd species. \u000d\u000aThis is important information, and tells us a lot about human nature, which has \u000d\u000aemancipated itself from the rest of nature to such an extent that it has produced \u000d\u000asomething like its own operating system. This does not apply only to law, but to all \u000d\u000ahuman activity. Human nature turned out to be so complex that natural mechanisms \u000d\u000awere no longer sufficient and man was forced to produce a new framework for his \u000d\u000aspecies, encompassing his functioning in reality. Moreover, other natural mechanisms, \u000d\u000aincluding the free market, were able to function better precisely because of legislated \u000d\u000alaw. \u000d\u000aSince in the domain of law, the natural must have recognised the primacy of state \u000d\u000alaw, by analogy, it is reasonable to argue that in the field of economic activity it must \u000d\u000abe similar. It turned out that the human environment, characterised by intentional \u000d\u000abehaviour, the reactive mechanism of the law of supply and demand can become a \u000d\u000anegative tool in the hands of a conscious being. Therefore, it must operate on the \u000d\u000abasis of legislated law, and therefore a mechanism devoid of reactive characteristics. \u000d\u000aConsequently, the obvious conclusion should be that man must also strive to develop \u000d\u000athe economic mechanisms themselves with a degree of complexity in their structure \u000d\u000aand adequate standards to accommodate the high degree of complexity of the \u000d\u000aenvironment they are to serve. ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 11\u000d\u000aIn an increasingly complex yet globalised world, it is becoming clear that the economy \u000d\u000ais a system of interconnected vessels, interacting ever more strongly with each other, \u000d\u000aespecially as it serves the closed environment that is our planet. It could be argued \u000d\u000athat it is beginning to interact with itself, as it naturally exhausts its diversity of \u000d\u000aownership of individual economic players and new areas of market expansion. It also \u000d\u000aloses competitiveness. \u000d\u000aIn addition to this, certain self-destructive processes can be observed, geared solely \u000d\u000atowards commercial objectives that have nothing to do with meeting social needs. \u000d\u000aPressure is being exerted on the political class to delegitimise various aspects of our \u000d\u000alives under the pretext of concern for people's health or environmental protection just\u000d\u000ato create space for new investments. Although pathological, this is at the same time a \u000d\u000anatural process of many actors following the principle of acting along the line of least \u000d\u000aresistance and economic cost. To some extent, in its structure, it resembles \u000d\u000aautoimmune diseases. \u000d\u000aThis phenomenon is further reinforced by the natural process, which has been going \u000d\u000aon for many decades and even generations, of the expansion of capital and the \u000d\u000aemergence of ever larger entities, up to the size of today's corporate giants. It is not \u000d\u000adifficult to see that what was once intended to serve competitiveness now \u000d\u000aparadoxically contributes to trends that monopolise the market. Another paradox is \u000d\u000athat what, thanks to the free market, was supposed to regulate itself automatically, \u000d\u000ahad to be corrected with the help of, antitrust institutions, i.e. by state \u000d\u000ainterventionism. \u000d\u000aIn spite of antitrust action, the market manifests a natural tendency towards the \u000d\u000aformation of large players and, in some industries, even cartels. With the help of \u000d\u000alegislation, more and more antitrust prohibitions can be created, but human creativity \u000d\u000awill be able to circumvent them in one way or another. These phenomena, in the \u000d\u000ahuman environment, are inevitable, because man, as a creature acting intentionally \u000d\u000aand consciously, and therefore acting actively, will always achieve an advantage over \u000d\u000athe simple and reactive algorithm of the law of supply and demand. These processes \u000d\u000asettle not so much at the economic, social or biological level, but at a more \u000d\u000aelementary level \u2013 at the level of physical layouts/systems that can be described in \u000d\u000athe language of mathematics. \u000d\u000aThe graphic below illustrates the difference between events occurring at random and \u000d\u000aintentional, human-specific action. ","Page 12 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aGraphic 3 \u2013 Comparison of two layouts \u000d\u000aIn a very similar way, intentional human action shapes processes related to the \u000d\u000afinancial side of the economy and the ubiquitous paradigm of financial profit, mainly \u000d\u000abased on a quick rate of return. \u000d\u000aCenturies ago, when the role of science and its impact on economic and civilisational \u000d\u000adevelopment was severely limited, it was not as important as it is today. In modern \u000d\u000atimes, the role of science in the economy began to grow rapidly. Over time, its impact \u000d\u000aon financial returns has clearly become significant. \u000d\u000a2.2 The dissonance between classical economics and progress \u000d\u000aAs in many systems in which the goals of different elements of a larger whole \u000d\u000asometimes cease to coincide, it has become apparent that, paradoxically, the \u000d\u000adevelopment of science can stand in the way of the economy's central imperative of \u000d\u000afinancial profit. Moreover, it can threaten entire industries. Thus, a turning point was \u000d\u000areached where the economy began to live its own life. It gradually ceased to play its \u000d\u000arole as the main engine of civilisation, seeing science as a threatening competitor. \u000d\u000aSince then, it is science that has become synonymous with development and a direct\u000d\u000atool for obtaining human well-being in the broadest sense and the main means of \u000d\u000aachieving overall absolute benefits on a macro scale, i.e. so universal as to be \u000d\u000arelevant to the interests of every individual \u2013 new technologies, medicines, vaccines, ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 13\u000d\u000aetc. Economics, on the other hand, has come to be primarily a source of providing \u000d\u000arelative benefits, i.e. mainly profits estimated in the relationship of a person or \u000d\u000aeconomic entity to other persons and entities \u2013 measured primarily by the criteria of \u000d\u000afinancial gains. \u000d\u000aEconomic processes obviously continue to support the scientific ones, contributing to \u000d\u000athe overall development of civilisation, as long as they do not interfere with the \u000d\u000aformer's main priority \u2013 financial profit. This is why a paradigm shift by replacing the \u000d\u000aeconomic imperative with the scientific one is so crucial. \u000d\u000aFinancial economics is a good example of how an economy left largely to spontaneous \u000d\u000amechanisms starts to split internally into different factions, further creating internal \u000d\u000astructural contradictions and damaging processes. Not only socially, but also \u000d\u000aeconomically. We often hear criticism of financial economics, which has emancipated \u000d\u000aitself from economic processes to such an extent that it has become a new branch of \u000d\u000athe economy, even though it does not actually produce any goods itself. It gives the \u000d\u000aimpression of being a cancer created by the organism on which it parasitizes. \u000d\u000aHowever, along with the criticism, there is no in-depth reflection that this is in fact a \u000d\u000anatural process of the classical economic model, exploiting its inertial nature. \u000d\u000aThe comments usually amount to criticism of the ethical attitudes of other people or \u000d\u000athe political class, with an uncritical attitude towards the very nature of the model.\u000d\u000aIn part, this is probably a typical psychological regularity, characterised by people \u000d\u000atreating the status quo with sufficiently long tenure as a natural state. \u000d\u000aMechanisms operating long enough in the human environment become naturally \u000d\u000aaxiomatised, becoming immune not only to their contestation but even to in-depth \u000d\u000aanalysis. \u000d\u000aSimilar processes form throughout an economy heavily based on inertial mechanism. \u000d\u000aThe whole system begins to function autonomously, subject to spontaneous \u000d\u000aprocesses, not necessarily always beneficial to man. What was supposed to be a \u000d\u000asource of many solutions for man becomes his trap and begins to be unfettered \u000d\u000afreedom for the system itself and the pathological phenomena that often accompany \u000d\u000ait. \u000d\u000aGenerated, socially harmful phenomena in free market processes most often become \u000d\u000aa challenge for state governments. In order to eliminate or offset them, central \u000d\u000aauthorities are forced to implement various regulations, which in turn conflict with \u000d\u000afree market principles. This creates a negative feedback loop from which there is no \u000d\u000agood way out. \u000d\u000aAny compromises in this area tend to become only ad hoc half-measures. There is no \u000d\u000agood synergy between one element and the other \u2013 the free market and regulation \u2013\u000d\u000abecause they are incompatible processes. The first element is a spontaneous and \u000d\u000achaotic process, while the nature of the second is characterised by a high degree of \u000d\u000aorderliness. Worst of all, however, is the fact that the incompatibility, and often the \u000d\u000adissimilarity of the objectives of the two, does not merely manifest itself in a lack of \u000d\u000acooperation, but in a mutual collision. \u000d\u000aSolutions that focus on the systemic use of scientific potential are those that will make \u000d\u000aa major contribution to the successive levelling out of the described conflict. \u000d\u000aOver time, they can eliminate this disharmony, replacing these phenomena with their \u000d\u000aown processes with positive results for all. Scientific potential, by virtue of its \u000d\u000auniversal nature, can combine creative and orderly elements. ","Page 14 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aThe scientific element will make it possible to free oneself from the unstable nature of \u000d\u000aeconomic processes operating in a strongly inertial environment. It is not about \u000d\u000apermanent human control of all processes, but about the elementary agency of \u000d\u000ahuman activities related to development in the broadest sense, supported by stability, \u000d\u000aa rational degree of order and an increase in its efficiency. \u000d\u000aChapter 3 \u2013 Synthesis of economic and scientific activities \u000d\u000a3.1 Historical stages of welfare creation \u000d\u000aSince prehistoric times, man has engaged in various activities to improve his material \u000d\u000asituation and general well-being. In different eras, different activities functioned as \u000d\u000amain or accompanying activities, ranging from a hunter-gatherer society through \u000d\u000aagriculture, to an era in which trade flourished with the development of civilisation, to \u000d\u000amodern times with the Industrial Revolution and widespread industrialisation. \u000d\u000aWhat they have in common is the extensive economy and management of natural \u000d\u000aresources. \u000d\u000aEach of these eras has left its mark on human civilisation. Some did so less, others to \u000d\u000aa greater extent. Some activities have been replaced by others, and still others have \u000d\u000aremained with us to this day. \u000d\u000aIf we analyse today's times and look at human activity, its characteristics, \u000d\u000ahabits, mental sphere, the priorities set to improve our well-being, etc., we \u000d\u000acan see that mentally we are strongly linked to the paradigms of commercial \u000d\u000aactivity. We can therefore conclude that we are still strongly influenced by \u000d\u000amerchant culture, being more or less aware of this fact. \u000d\u000aOn the one hand, we are aware of the power of science, but on the other, we \u000d\u000aare more attached to mercantile solutions, as we have mainly been shaped \u000d\u000aby them. \u000d\u000aAnother common feature of the activities mentioned is their unreliability, \u000d\u000atransience, and the fact that they are being replaced by those of greater \u000d\u000acomplexity and involvement of intellectual potential. We conclude that they \u000d\u000ado not represent universal solutions, but are merely the product of our \u000d\u000aintellect, representing a certain level at a certain time, just like the whole \u000d\u000adevelopment of civilisation. \u000d\u000aJust as at the time of the transition between the feudal system and free market \u000d\u000acapitalism, it was hard for many people to realise that there could be any better world \u000d\u000aorder than the monarchy with its hierarchical structure, so today we fall into an \u000d\u000aanalogous cognitive trap, axiomatically recognising one or another current model as \u000d\u000anon-alternative and being the best possible guarantor of prosperity and civilisational \u000d\u000adevelopment. ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 15\u000d\u000aMeanwhile, we are dealing with the opposite process, in which our cognitive functions \u000d\u000aplay a central role. They are the source giving rise to different eras, social, economic \u000d\u000aand political orders and, most significantly, technological ones. \u000d\u000aFrom historical examples, we can observe quite close correlations between openness \u000d\u000ato cognitive processes: educational, exploratory or related to the exchange of \u000d\u000ainformation between different cultural circles and faster civilisational development. \u000d\u000aIt was, among other things, the great geographical discoveries at the end of the 15th \u000d\u000acentury that provided a huge developmental impulse and a milestone towards the \u000d\u000aRenaissance and the flowering of many fields, including science, and then the Age of \u000d\u000aEnlightenment. \u000d\u000aIt is very difficult to imagine the social, philosophical, political, economic, \u000d\u000ascientific, technological and, above all, mental changes in the Age of \u000d\u000aEnlightenment without the influence of the Renaissance on the development \u000d\u000aof Europe. Furthermore, it is above all thanks to this cause-and-effect \u000d\u000arelationship that the idea of liberalism, free-market capitalism or the \u000d\u000aIndustrial Revolution could have emerged. This cause-and-effect relationship \u000d\u000ais incomparably more important than the direct correlation between free \u000d\u000amarket capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. \u000d\u000aWhile the link between free market capitalism and the Industrial Revolution \u000d\u000ais natural, the more significant and necessary condition for the emergence of \u000d\u000aboth and each separately was the fundamental intellectual change that had \u000d\u000apreviously taken place in European society and the Western world as a \u000d\u000awhole. \u000d\u000aThe free market of the 18th and 19th centuries therefore did not arise in isolation \u000d\u000afrom reality, but was a natural consequence of earlier processes. \u000d\u000aVarious forms of capitalism arose much earlier, as early as the 13th and 14th \u000d\u000acenturies in Italy and even in ancient times. However, they did not record such a \u000d\u000adevelopment as the capitalism of the nineteenth century for various reasons, but \u000d\u000aabove all because they lacked a sufficiently high technological level, which, thanks to \u000d\u000athe development of science, could only materialise five hundred years later in the \u000d\u000aform of the Industrial Revolution. \u000d\u000aTherefore, the main cause and source of development in the broadest sense of the \u000d\u000aterm and the methods for creating wealth should not be sought in such or such a \u000d\u000adifferent economic system, but in man's natural creative abilities and the creation of \u000d\u000aoptimal conditions for their maximum possible use. Of course, models may differ in \u000d\u000atheir effectiveness in unleashing human intellectual potential, but as a general rule, \u000d\u000athe source of progress remains the cognitive functions with which nature has endowed \u000d\u000aus through evolution. \u000d\u000aMerchant culture was so firmly entrenched in human consciousness that even the rival \u000d\u000aeconomic systems of the 20th century \u2013 capitalism and socialism/communism \u2013\u000d\u000adespite their many differences, were strongly influenced by it, basing their doctrines \u000d\u000aon the production of goods without much reflection on the exploitation of natural \u000d\u000aresources, environmental or social factors or the overall strategy of their production in \u000d\u000athe context of optimising civilisational development. In the case of communist states, \u000d\u000athe role of merchant/trader was played by their authoritarian central authorities. \u000d\u000aAs a species, however, we tend to overestimate the status quo, which we have often \u000d\u000amischaracterised throughout history as the end state, or even the perfect state. ","Page 16 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aThe reason for this is probably a lack of sufficient cognitive capacity and anticipation \u000d\u000abeyond our own era. Although, when viewed from a statistical point of view and \u000d\u000ahistorical experience, the belief in the uniqueness of one's own era and the \u000d\u000auniversality of the characteristics of the various elements within it is unlikely and very \u000d\u000ana\u00efve.\u000d\u000aOf course, new solutions are not always the right ones. Examples from history in the \u000d\u000aform of communism or fascism best demonstrate this. However, the nature of \u000d\u000apathological cases reveals its face quite quickly. Fascism, as a caricature of the state \u000d\u000aand republicanism, and communism, as a caricature of community, social solidarity \u000d\u000aand constructive socialist demands, appeared already in their beginnings as \u000d\u000aphenomena of suspicion and horror. Their bloody totalitarianisms, brutally combating \u000d\u000aall expressions of freedom, became the ultimate confirmation of this. \u000d\u000a3.2 The key role of intellectual capacity \u000d\u000aThe only element, distinguished by universal characteristics, that we can \u000d\u000aobserve in these processes is the human intellect. It is the human cognitive \u000d\u000afunction that is the true engine of progress, which nothing else has been able \u000d\u000ato replace so far, and certainly not this simple algorithm of the law of supply \u000d\u000aand demand. Lessons from history should be learned, no less, nowadays, \u000d\u000ascience should be our natural choice as a means of achieving our goals, \u000d\u000aespecially as the existing ones in the form of the classical economy are \u000d\u000aincreasingly starting to fail and generate negativity. \u000d\u000aNaturally, pathological economic mechanisms have an impact on very practical \u000d\u000aaspects affecting each of us: the use of cheaper components for products such as cars \u000d\u000aat the expense of human safety, the planned mass ageing of products by most \u000d\u000amanufacturers, price collusion, or the mass production of unhealthy, highly processed \u000d\u000afood. These examples are just a drop in the ocean of all phenomena in the market. \u000d\u000aThese are not extreme cases, but rules applied by economic operators. \u000d\u000aThere are many examples of pathological behaviour in the market that are derived \u000d\u000afrom human actions, but which the free market alone cannot prevent. It is possible to \u000d\u000aenvisage a situation where several powerful players in the market, who should \u000d\u000atheoretically be competing with each other, will in reality be more inclined towards \u000d\u000atacit cooperation or at least mutual neutrality. \u000d\u000aThis is because these players are human beings \u2013 conscious, intentional beings, \u000d\u000alimited by their own behaviourism \u2013 who make calculations. They may come to the \u000d\u000aconclusion that, from a certain point onwards, it will be more comfortable for them to \u000d\u000amaintain their position in the market, and that an assurance action is more beneficial, \u000d\u000aproviding a sense of stability and security as opposed to risky competition and the \u000d\u000auncertainty that comes with it. \u000d\u000aThe entry of new players into the market in such a situation more often ends in \u000d\u000atheoretical considerations than in practice. Examples are sometimes given of powerful \u000d\u000anew companies in the IT industry, among others, which until recently were \u000d\u000ainsignificant players. At the same time, it is forgotten that the IT domain is a \u000d\u000arelatively young industry and has already been dominated by a few, which only \u000d\u000aconfirms the general trend towards monopolisation in the market. ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 17\u000d\u000aLarge economic players exploiting their position and power in the market are also \u000d\u000abecoming a threat to freedom and democracy more broadly. \u000d\u000aOne can be critical of this state of affairs, or one can look at it realistically and \u000d\u000aconclude that it is an immanent and natural feature of the market, occurring \u000d\u000aaccording to the principle that if it is possible to achieve a superior goal through the \u000d\u000apath of least resistance, this is the path that will be taken. It is possible to defend and \u000d\u000aexplain such processes with arguments of economic viability, or even social benefits, \u000d\u000aassociated with the labour market. However, this will always just be a defence of the \u000d\u000airrational status quo while ignoring the attempt to apply any alternative. \u000d\u000aIt is always the case that major changes bring side effects and accompanying social\u000d\u000aunrest, but we cannot stop the inevitable processes, led by the robotisation and \u000d\u000aautomation of many industries. It would even be detrimental to do so. On the other \u000d\u000ahand, avoiding solving problems in advance, which will happen anyway, is all the \u000d\u000amore irrational. \u000d\u000aSuch phenomena on a broader scale result in the economy taking two steps forward \u000d\u000aand one step backwards in the context of civilisation. The point is that all steps should \u000d\u000abe steps taken forward. \u000d\u000aIf a comparison is made between a model in which an entity makes an investment \u000d\u000awith a greater commitment to scientific potential in the development of, for example, \u000d\u000amedicine, rather than an investment geared towards a quick rate of return, it will \u000d\u000amost often become apparent that the former investment model will be more \u000d\u000afavourable to the entity in the long term. The credibility of the entity will also become \u000d\u000aan important factor. The price will be a longer time to wait for the final result, but the \u000d\u000abonus of using scientific solutions will bring disproportionately greater economic, but \u000d\u000aalso civilisational benefits compared to the classical model. \u000d\u000aThe values derived from such a model, also on a wider scale, will prove to be \u000d\u000adisproportionately greater for all than in the traditional model, the more they are \u000d\u000aimplemented en masse and in many domains simultaneously. The scientific factor is \u000d\u000amany times a more effective means of arriving at more advanced and satisfying \u000d\u000asolutions and overall well-being in all aspects of our lives than the traditional model, \u000d\u000awhich aims almost exclusively at financial gain. \u000d\u000aThe economic model supported by scientific achievements is so effective that it will \u000d\u000aultimately prove to be more beneficial even to wealthy individuals, as the increased \u000d\u000aquality of human existence on a macro scale will surpass that achieved by classical \u000d\u000amethods and financial engineering by the large market players. \u000d\u000aIt is not difficult to imagine many examples of this type, where, for example, a newly \u000d\u000adeveloped cure for a hitherto incurable disease, the general level of medicine, new \u000d\u000atechnologies to facilitate a comfortable life, or the production of healthy food and a \u000d\u000ageneral increase in quality of life using a science-supported model, will be \u000d\u000aincomparably more important to these people than the financial fortunes gained with \u000d\u000awhich goods can be acquired, but of limited capacity and quality. \u000d\u000aThe quick rate of return and the culture associated with the classic model, the mental \u000d\u000aissues and the business decisions taken, although short-sighted, may seem more \u000d\u000aattractive and safer for business ventures. Much, therefore, depends on the \u000d\u000asuccessive implementation of comprehensive systemic solutions, statutory legal \u000d\u000aregulations \u2013 e.g. liberalisation of patent law \u2013 social issues, while activation, \u000d\u000amotivation and support mechanisms from the public sector at all levels. ","Page 18 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aMultidimensional cooperation at the international level, while respecting the sovereign \u000d\u000adecisions of all political actors, is also desirable. \u000d\u000aThere is a need for serious public sector participation in these processes, both from \u000d\u000athe scientific and logistical base, as well as from the many complex economic \u000d\u000aactivities linking many industries. Finally, a lot of information, organisational and also \u000d\u000aeducational work is needed on the culture of exploiting scientific potential and the \u000d\u000amany sociological aspects in this area. \u000d\u000aWhen creating an adequate research base, particular care should be taken to create \u000d\u000amotivational factors. In addition to various financial aspects such as offers of \u000d\u000apreferential loans for this type of activity or taxation of large economic entities, \u000d\u000aattractive conditions must be created for better quality and faster career development \u000d\u000aof scientific personnel. \u000d\u000aThe activity of the public sector, in cooperation with private entities, should \u000d\u000abecome a very important factor in the form of competitiveness in relation to \u000d\u000athe rest of the market in the production of goods and services in the context \u000d\u000aof their civilisational values, and not only commercial ones. Over time, \u000d\u000ascience-based projects will, thanks to their efficiency, also start to \u000d\u000acompensate for the investment costs associated with the slower rate of \u000d\u000areturn and the problems inherent in processes at an early stage of their \u000d\u000adevelopment, compared to the classic model. \u000d\u000aWith the right organisation and synergies between the various economic \u000d\u000aactivities and the scientific base, these ventures will be able to positively \u000d\u000aaddress the financing of their own ongoing development at an increasingly \u000d\u000arapid pace. \u000d\u000aIn very many cases, it is not so much the specific amount of investment that matters \u000d\u000aas the methodology used. It is very important to make optimum use of the creative \u000d\u000afactor, and not just the reproductive one, at man's disposal, and to replace quantity \u000d\u000awith quality in action. It is, after all, reason that is the greatest attribute of our \u000d\u000aspecies, not coincidentally called Homo Sapiens by ourselves, which should oblige \u000d\u000ahumanity all the more strongly to use it effectively. \u000d\u000aSuch a model will better benefit both the individual and the public, across the \u000d\u000aspectrum of quality of life. This is supported by the rationality implicit in the \u000d\u000aeffectiveness of scientific solutions and the stability implicit in the more \u000d\u000astructured nature of this model. \u000d\u000aThe graphic below indicatively shows how, over the centuries, science, thanks to \u000d\u000aman's natural cognitive functions, in addition to strictly economic activities, has \u000d\u000agained increasing influence on the development of civilisation over the last \u000d\u000amillennium. ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 19\u000d\u000a Graphic 4 \u2013 Impact of economy and science on the development \u000d\u000ao of civilisation \u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a3.3 Cognitive errors in assessing the status quo \u000d\u000aThe production of added value in economic processes gives a sense of continuous \u000d\u000aprogress, overshadowing the powerful human capabilities that can already be \u000d\u000aachieved through creative processes, which are not being given good enough \u000d\u000aconditions to realise their full potential. An economy based on maximising this \u000d\u000apotential and applying systemic solutions to it will create an entirely new quality. \u000d\u000aOne of the problems standing in the way of seeing these possibilities is limited human \u000d\u000aperception. Man's lifespan is so relatively short that he does not notice processes that \u000d\u000aare happening all the time. At least not to the extent they deserve, misjudging many \u000d\u000amechanisms as unchangeable and universal, as if they were linear. \u000d\u000aUsually, human attention is attracted to single elements that belong to a larger whole. \u000d\u000aIf they are locally beneficial, they are unlikely to provide the impetus for a deeper \u000d\u000aanalysis of their nature or synthesis. On the contrary, they will reinforce habits and \u000d\u000areinforce the belief that there are no better alternatives to them. \u000d\u000aOne can compare this situation to the problem associated with observing the \u000d\u000acurvature of the Earth. No one pays any attention to such a fact, especially as it is \u000d\u000aimperceptible on the scale on which we operate. Nonetheless, we are aware of how ","Page 20 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000aimportant it is as a factor that makes our existence possible at all. Human perception \u000d\u000aresembles a situation with two straight lines and a minimum angle between them, \u000d\u000awhich locally will be of no interest. \u000d\u000aThis state of affairs will produce a false sense of consistency between theoretical \u000d\u000aassumptions and practice. However, this is only until the consequences associated \u000d\u000awith the global scale begin to make themselves strongly felt. An analogous situation \u000d\u000aapplies to human perception, habits and illusions associated with classical economic \u000d\u000aprocesses. In this case, the realisation of significant inconsistencies can be quite a \u000d\u000along process. \u000d\u000aMeanwhile, the processes regarding the capabilities of the world of science, \u000d\u000aare not only occurring at a rapid pace, but are progressing exponentially, \u000d\u000aincreasing their still untapped value. \u000d\u000aThe vast majority of the negative processes that emerged in the economy were the \u000d\u000ainevitable order of things and, contrary to popular opinion, it turned out that the \u000d\u000aoverriding objective of the economy was never really the achievement of general \u000d\u000awell-being for the population as a whole, but the financial profit of a specific entity, \u000d\u000apreferably with a quick rate of return. The goal of achieving general prosperity was \u000d\u000aand still is necessarily only an accompanying objective. \u000d\u000aAlthough, in such cases, a large percentage of the population may still be convinced \u000d\u000aotherwise and, through the power of habit and suggestion, go through a kind of \u000d\u000aprocess of denial, eventually, sooner or later, a logical fact must reach people's \u000d\u000aconsciousness: the path between the intention (the goal set) and the \u000d\u000aattainment of a goal of the best possible quality, is the more efficient and \u000d\u000ashorter the fewer intermediate elements there are on it. \u000d\u000aThis universal principle also applies to all economic processes, concerning, among \u000d\u000aother things, the entire process of material goods/products. In the classical economic \u000d\u000amodel, this intermediate element is burdened with an overriding objective in the form \u000d\u000aof financial profit, which may or may not be strictly correlated with the optimal \u000d\u000aachievement of the objective. Moreover, it may even be in conflict with it. \u000d\u000aIdeally, there should be no intermediate elements at all, as illustrated in the graphic \u000d\u000abelow. ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 21\u000d\u000aGraphic 5 \u2013 Process with and without intermediate element \u000d\u000aThe more and more tools \u2013 economic actors \u2013 man has at his disposal, the remedial \u000d\u000amechanisms naturally attributed to the free market become more and more limited. \u000d\u000aThis is why, centuries ago and even a few decades ago, it was possible to overlook \u000d\u000avarious risks. Although the mechanism of the free market is immutable, it operates in \u000d\u000aa permanently changing human environment, which is gaining an ever-increasing \u000d\u000aadvantage over this mechanism at an exponential rate. \u000d\u000aThe crux of the issue, then, lies not in the free market as such, but in the \u000d\u000aunwillingness to accept that this mechanism is increasingly unable to live up to its role \u000d\u000ain the surrounding reality. As with the abacus in the computer age, the problem lies \u000d\u000anot in the inaccuracy of this tool, but in its lack of functionality and efficiency. \u000d\u000aInterventionism, on the other hand, has acquired a bad name, whereas in reality it is \u000d\u000anothing more than an intentional human action which, depending on the context, can \u000d\u000abe either a positive or negative phenomenon or simply neutral. And as such, in \u000d\u000aisolation from other human actions, it does not constitute a concrete mechanism or \u000d\u000asystem. ","Page 22 The Optimized Economy Manifesto\u000d\u000a3.4 Conclusions and objectives to be pursued \u000d\u000aAs conscious beings with a sense of responsibility for ourselves and our species as a \u000d\u000awhole, we are largely, or even mostly, condemned to intentional actions, which \u000d\u000arequire the development of a range of optimized and effectively functioning processes, \u000d\u000aproceedings and behaviours, including in the economic domain. Not only those \u000d\u000adirectly derived from our intellect, but also from scientific and technological advances, \u000d\u000asuch as artificial intelligence. There is also a need to implement solutions of an \u000d\u000ainterdisciplinary nature, not only for the individual, but also for entire groups of \u000d\u000aeconomic actors, complementing each other and cooperating under the auspices of a \u000d\u000asingle management. \u000d\u000aDue to the nature of such a model, it is impossible to speak of any specific key on \u000d\u000awhich it would be based. It will certainly not be a specific mechanism/algorithm, but, \u000d\u000aas in the case of statute law, an elaborated whole set of legal, social, sociological or \u000d\u000amotivational aspects, exploiting the creative nature of man, constantly subject to \u000d\u000aadjustments, taking into account the changing nature of the human environment over \u000d\u000atime. \u000d\u000aNegative motivation schemes are quite ineffective. The shameful and inhumane \u000d\u000aexamples from ancient and modern history using slave systems are proof of this. \u000d\u000aSchemes based on purely reproductive activity are also less effective than creative \u000d\u000aactivity, because in the case of the dear one we have a strong correlation with an \u000d\u000aanthropological factor, specific to humans, related to the cognitive functions to which \u000d\u000awe owe our evolutionary success in general. \u000d\u000aIn this field, human beings are particularly and naturally active, even in the absence \u000d\u000aof additional motivational factors. Reinforcement with additional motivation by \u000d\u000acreating appropriate conditions for the use of these activities, especially among \u000d\u000aintellectually outstanding but also average individuals, will contribute all the more to \u000d\u000agreater achievements in the scientific field, and thus to the emergence of new \u000d\u000atechnologies and a more efficient economy. \u000d\u000aMany ideas that mankind had previously rejected as unrealistic or for mental reasons, \u000d\u000acultural prejudices or habits, were put into practice after a while anyway. Often out of \u000d\u000acompulsion rather than goodwill. This is how we approached, among other things, the \u000d\u000aconcept of universal education, including women's education or, finally, a system of \u000d\u000agovernance based on democracy. As a consequence, these proved not only viable, but \u000d\u000aindispensable. \u000d\u000aIt is no different today, when we are increasingly condemned to make concrete \u000d\u000adecisions, not leaving things to their own devices, if only in the context of acquiring \u000d\u000anew energy sources. The natural resources we possess are not part of a theoretical \u000d\u000amodel with infinite parameters, but their quantity is defined by specific numbers. \u000d\u000aTheir depletion will sooner or later force us to take specific, targeted action, before \u000d\u000aeconomic operators decide to use other resources, cheaper to obtain, but not \u000d\u000anecessarily beneficial or profitable in the long term from the point of view of the \u000d\u000aconsumer, or with a negative impact on the environment and humans themselves. \u000d\u000aThe economy and its closely related quality and lifestyle also have a huge impact not \u000d\u000aonly on the individual, but on society as a whole. The consequences of this in turn \u000d\u000ahave a great impact on a myriad of social phenomena. One of these is the \u000d\u000aconsequences for the demographic structure. Market mechanisms often have ","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 23\u000d\u000adisastrous and irreversible effects on many of these aspects, but solving the problems \u000d\u000athey generate is most often left to the intervention of the authorities. \u000d\u000aIt is common to trivialise and shallow these issues, shifting various problems to the \u000d\u000anext generation. Social problems induce difficulties with the economic situation, thus \u000d\u000aclosing the cycle of consequences caused by the spontaneous nature of classical \u000d\u000amarket processes. \u000d\u000aThe more we deal with economic mechanisms of an inertial nature, such as the \u000d\u000aclassical economic model, the more it is impossible to predict and estimate all their \u000d\u000areal costs. \u000d\u000aA strange paradox therefore occurs. In a world dominated by reckoning with economic\u000d\u000acosts at every turn, no account is taken of the calculation of gains and losses brought \u000d\u000aabout by the very use of such an economic criterion. This is often argued on the basis \u000d\u000aof the lack of such possibilities, which only confirms the lack of justification for the \u000d\u000abelief that there is no alternative to this state of affairs, even though, in fact, we all \u000d\u000aincreasingly recognise the growing limitations and declining efficiency of the classical \u000d\u000amodel. \u000d\u000aSuch a belief, as in most cases, stems from a psychological factor and the strength of \u000d\u000aattachment to the status quo. This is one of the classic examples of form over \u000d\u000asubstance and habit over rationality. \u000d\u000aProblems of this type are increasing exponentially in a globalised world. \u000d\u000aAlready today, free market processes alone cannot handle our reality, and the area of \u000d\u000atheir possibilities is shrinking drastically. To all this must be added the protectionist \u000d\u000aeconomic policies of various countries and the disturbing phenomena associated with \u000d\u000athe announced attempts by authoritarian states to implement grand projects not only \u000d\u000ain the economic domain, but also in the scientific domain, which do not in any way \u000d\u000atake into account social or financial costs. \u000d\u000aAs a result, human decision-making with an element of science will have to \u000d\u000asuccessively displace free market processes as spontaneous and become the \u000d\u000amainstream model. In such a reality, there will also be a place for the free market as \u000d\u000aa complementary element, functioning in synergy with the future mainstream model. \u000d\u000aIt is no less important to be aware that the role of science will become dominant in \u000d\u000athe most crucial and strategic sectors of the economy, including major areas of social \u000d\u000alife. \u000d\u000aWe need to realise that many of the problems we create ourselves, by virtue \u000d\u000aof our intellectual level and conscious action, are so highly complex that, in \u000d\u000aorder to solve them, a simple algorithm, e.g. a free market one, is not \u000d\u000aenough, but it is precisely our intentional action, representing the same level \u000d\u000aof complexity, which will be able to meet such challenges, that is required. \u000d\u000aThe sooner we initiate these necessary processes, the sooner we will reap their \u000d\u000apositive fruits in the form of a more efficient material and immaterial development of \u000d\u000aour civilisation for the overall benefit of all mankind. \u000d\u000aSylwester Fiet \u000d\u000aMarch 2023","","The Optimized Economy Manifesto Page 25\u000d\u000aList of graphics \u000d\u000aGraphic 1 \u2013 Three levels/stages of the economy ............................................ 6 \u000d\u000aGraphic 2 \u2013 Comparison of two investment models ........................................ 8 \u000d\u000aGraphic 3 \u2013 Comparison of two layouts ......................................................... 12 \u000d\u000aGraphic 4 \u2013 Impact of economy and science on the development \u000d\u000aof civilisation ................................................................................................ 19 \u000d\u000aGraphic 5 \u2013 Process with and without intermediate element ........................ 21 ","","","Return to beginning of document \u000d\u000aOptimized Economy\u000d\u000ahttps://optimizedeconomy.blogspot.com/ \u000d\u000aAuthor: Sylwester Fiet\u000d\u000aP\u0142ock, Poland 2023 \u000d\u000aContact: sylwester1975pl@gmail.com\u000d\u000a "]
